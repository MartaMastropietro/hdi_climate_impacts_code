This dataset is a global gridded population dataset covering 248 countries or areas at 30 arc-seconds (approximately 1 km) spatial resolution with five-year intervals for the period 2020â€“2100 by implementing random forest (RF) algorithm. It is quantitatively consistent with the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) national population. The grids are stored in five folders in GEOTIFF format.
